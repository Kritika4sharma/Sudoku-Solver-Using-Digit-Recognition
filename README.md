# Sudoku-Solver-Using-Digit-Recognition

###Languages used : Python 2.7 and C++

###Libraries Needed:
* Python Imaging Library (PIL)
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* OpenCV2

###Classification Algorithm: 
*K Nearest Neighbours*

###Heuristics used in solving sudoku: 
*Minimum remaining values* and *Degree Heuristic*

###Usage : 
```
python solver.py <image file>
```

###For Training : 
```
python create_training.py
```

This will create 2 files : **trainingdata.txt** and **traininglable.txt**

###ToDos:
* Implement Neural Network for detection of digits
* Currently the algorithm is working on a template for sudoku. Try to generalize it.
